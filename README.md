SHORC is a browser extension that converts YouTube shorts into normal videos with ease.

1. SHORC inserts a convert button in the YouTube shorts page. It is placed above the comments button in the shorts controls.
2. SHORC will auto-convert shorts to normal videos if you turn on "auto-convert" in the extension popover
3. You can also click the "Convert this Video" button in the extension popover

This extension is only available on chromium based browsers at the moment
