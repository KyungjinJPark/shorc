SHORC is a browser extension that converts YouTube shorts into normal videos with ease.

1. Press `Ctrl+Y` to convert the short on the current tab to a normal video
2. SHORC inserts a convert button in the YouTube shorts page. It is placed above the comments button in the shorts controls.
3. SHORC will auto-convert shorts to normal videos if you turn on "auto-convert" in the extension popover
4. You can also click the "Convert this Video" button in the extension popover

This extension is only available on chromium based browsers at the moment
